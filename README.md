Introduction
------------

This project is an integration of the MSP430 toolchain into bazel, specifically
to be run on macOS.

Dependencies (macOS)
--------------------

1. mspdebug: This is very easy to install by just using `brew install mspdebug`.
1. MSP430LPCDC.kext: This kernel extension will configure correctly the port for
                     mspdebug to install the binary onto the platform. The
                     extension can be found
                     [here](https://code.google.com/archive/p/msp430lpcdc/downloads).
                     Download and put this file in `/System/Library/Extensions`
                     and reboot your computer.

Installation (macOS)
-------------------

Once you have the dependencies installed, run the `install-tools.sh` script
inside `tools/msp430`. This will fetch the compiler and support files needed for
compilation and linking.

Usage
-----

To build a binary file, just use `bazel build //path/to/msp430_binary:target`.
To install onto a device, use `bazel run //path/to/msp430_binary:target`.
